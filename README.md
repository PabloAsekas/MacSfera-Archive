MacSfera is the blog I ran between 2010 and 2019. It was about Apple: news, hardware, software, opinion, and reviews.

I designed and built the template, wrote most of the articles and took/created all the images with a "MacSfera" watermark. The other photos are from the Internet with the respective credit in the post.

The original version of MacSfera was built with WordPress, running on a VPS with a CDN for the media content.

The current website is a static version of that WordPress blog. It has all the content published and all the functionality but the search engine, the comments and the footnotes.

Here it is as a reminder of all the work I made since I was 16 years old. Learning how to set up servers, domains, SSL certificates, CDNs, web design, PHP and WordPress, take quality photos and edit them, write and, last but not least, tell stories.

All of that drove me to the point I am now: working professionally as a software engineer and writing stories for myself.

Cheers.
